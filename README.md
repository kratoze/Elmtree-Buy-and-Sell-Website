# Elmtree Buy and Sell Website

Project completed in 2019 (before I learned the importance of project structure!)
for Web Development Module for MSc Software Development at
Queen's University.

A website that allows a user to create a buyer or seller account, post product
listings, edit product and account details, rate sellers, sort products by category and
location.

Uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. Styled with SemanticUI CSS library.
